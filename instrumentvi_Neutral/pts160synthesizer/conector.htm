        <td><p><strong>To make use of the parallel programming
        port, you need a connector like that shown above. The one
        shown is a standard office telephone connector. Ask your
        telephone repair man for a short 25 pair jumper cable (25
        pair = 50 pins) and you might get what you need for
        FREE!.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>You can also find this connector at a computer
        store. It's known as a SCSI-I connector. But expect to
        pay top dollar for it unless you're lucky!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Another option is to purchase an Amphenol
        57-30500 connector as described on page 23, 30 &amp; 35
        of the manual.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I cut mine off of a 25 pair office telephone
        cable leaving the wires a couple feet long so I could
        solder the DB-25 on the other end to plug into the
        printer port.</strong></p>
