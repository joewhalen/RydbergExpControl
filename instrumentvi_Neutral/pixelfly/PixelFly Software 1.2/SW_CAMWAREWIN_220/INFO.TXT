Welcome to the new Camera Control Program "CamWare" from PCO.

PLEASE READ!! IMPORTANT INFORMATION!!!
Especially the accellerator keys.

CamWare is designed for applications, where common features are
required. It is compatibel with all PCO digital cameras especially
"pco.camera, SensiCam, DiCam Pro, PixelFly and HSFC"

Some new features are implemented in the new version:

- Default file format changed to 'multi'-TIFF.

- Additonal color conversion algorythms (RGB16!).

- Export to AVI and MPEG added.

- Enhanced direct record to file with all pco cameras (single camera).

- Logfiles. If you run into trouble you are able to generate logfiles,
  which will aid you and our support to get faster in trouble shooting.
  Additionally you will be enabled to create and send a 'support' file
  by email. This feature can be reached inside the about box.

- The convert control dialog has full gamma support, now. (You can control
  the gamma setting by pressing and holding down the right mouse button
  inside the red square of the dialog.)

- Too less memory available with your PixelFly and SensiCam? Try to start
  with the following registry key set to 1:
  HKCU/SoftWare/PCO/CamWare/DummyAllocRun
  This commits memory at the 'preferred load address' of dlls. Those dlls
  will be positioned by the OS in an optimal way, which reduces memory
  fragmentation. 
  If you run into memory trouble, please reduce DummyAllocLimitation.

Some menu items have been adapted in order to be more 'Windows'structured.

A few menu items can be accessed through accellerator keys.

- You can control the minimum and the maximum values used for the 
  conversion from 12 to 8 bit with the mouse. Move the mouse cursor 
  into a region which should be shown with maximum contrast. Press the
  shift and the left mouse button. Hold down the mouse button while 
  increasing the size of the rubberband window with mouse moves.
  After releasing of the mouse button the coordinates of the rubberband
  window act as a border for calculating the min. and max. values.

- In the same manner you can define a new region of interest for the
  camera. Just press the CTRL (Strg) button instead of
  the shift button. The coordinates of the rubberband window are
  used for calculating a new region of interest.
  You can reset the ROI to maximum by pressing the CTRL (Strg) button
  and clicking the right mouse button inside the image window.

in the application directory of 'CamWare.exe'.
